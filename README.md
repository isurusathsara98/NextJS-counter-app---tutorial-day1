Embarked on a 14-day React/Next.js practice challenge against ChatGPT 5.0 🚀
It’s definitely not a fair matchup 😅, but that’s the fun of it. This journey is all about improving my coding skills, tackling problems in new ways, and exploring Next.js more creatively and hands-on.

This repo kicks off with Day 1: Counter App — a simple project where I practiced useState, event handling, and conditional rendering, while also adding my own styling and a “Last Action” tracker to make it more personal.

Each day I’ll take on a new mini-project, getting a bit more challenging as I go. ChatGPT will be my coding sparring partner 🤖 vs 🧑‍💻 — and by the end, I hope to look back at 14 days of solid growth as a React/Next.js developer.
